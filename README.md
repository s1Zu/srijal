This is just a sample in which i first created a directory on my local host. Then created a git repository. And made some commits and saved. Then i tried to login to this remote repository like github. So i logged in to the Github  and created a new empty repository there and added all the files that were on my local machine on the git repository. THIS ALL TASK WAS DONE BY USING THE COMMAND PROMPT.
